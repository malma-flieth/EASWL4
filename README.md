In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use Python especially for the data analysis and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for the parameter estimation.

## [DatafileForLecture.csv]

This csv file is a data used for this lecture.
This data is obtained from Laigle et al. 2016 and Smolcic et al. 2017 after the cross-matching.
For this lecture, we removed many columns for simplicity (original data has more than 500 columns).
Please go to see those papers and try to analyze the original data if you are further interested in their research.
